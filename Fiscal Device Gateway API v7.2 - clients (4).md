1. DOCUMENT SUMMARY 
1.1. Definitions 
Term Description Device or Fiscal device Hardware based or software-based solution which is accounting sales (issues fiscal invoices, debit or credit notes) and submits them to FDMS. Device signature Receipt signature signed by fiscal device before submission of a receipt to Fiscal Device Gateway API. Fiscal Device Gateway API FDMS system module responsible for fiscal invoices, debit, or credit notes acceptance from fiscal devices. Fiscalisation Data 
Management System 
(FDMS) Fiscalisation Data Management System means Fiscalisation Backend system used by the Commissioner or the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority to receive, control and monitor User business transactions recorded by Electronic Fiscal Devices interfaced to it and to generate various required reports for the purposes of tax revenue administration. FDMS signature Receipt signature signed by FDMS after submission of a fiscal invoices, debit, or credit notes to Fiscal Device Gateway API. QR code A machine-readable code consisting of an array of black and white squares storing fiscal invoices, debit, or credit notes identification information, required to validate a receipt. QR code data QR code data is one of few receipt identification fields stored in QR code, which represents fiscal invoices, debit, or credit notes device signature. Receipt Receipt encompasses fiscal invoice, debit, or credit note. ZIMRA Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.  	 

2. FISCAL DEVICE GATEWAY USAGE SCENARIOS 
2.1. Device registration 
       The process starts when a taxpayer initially registers or updates their information using the Zimra registration portal. After completing this process, the taxpayer is provided with device ID and Activation Key. Device registration must be done once before starting to use a new device. After device registration, it needs to get its configurations (config) from FDMS. 
 
 
 
2.2. Fiscal device communication modes 
       Fiscal device communicates with Fiscal Device Gateway API in one of two possible communication modes: 
• Online 
• Offline 
       Online communication mode represents fiscal device communication in a way when fiscal device must have online access to FDMS (must have internet connection available) when it wants to close fiscal day. Fiscal day opening and submission of a receipt to FDMS should be done immediately after opening a day or printing receipt or invoice for buyer respectively, however in case of missing internet connection, day opening message and submission of a receipt may be delayed but must be done before closing a fiscal day. In case fiscal day was opened and receipt was issued without internet connection, it is mandatory, that fiscal day opening message would be sent before sending receipts. Otherwise, receipts will not be accepted. 
       Offline communication mode represents fiscal device communication in a way, when fiscal device may not have internet, and its receipts and fiscal report data will be provided to FDMS by using files (by uploading file using Self-service, or by sending file to Fiscal Device Gateway API, whenever connection will be available). 
 
2.3. Fiscal day (in online mode) 
       After successful device registration, it can be used for submitting sales to FDMS. Sales submission is possible only when fiscal day is opened. When work is finished with device, it must close fiscal day. 
 
 
       In case of error in fiscal day report processing report must be corrected on device and resubmitted to FDMS. Report resubmission can be done unlimited number of times. In case it does not give successful result, and supplier cannot fix it to submit successful report, fiscal day may be closed manually by supplier in Public Portal, or by ZIMRA officer. 
 
2.4. Fiscal day (in offline mode) 
 
       If device has internet connection, it should call getConfig method, to get device configuration information.  
       Device opens fiscal day, if device has internet connection it can send information using submitFile method (file with only header) about opened day. 
       Invoices are issued which are saved in device if device has internet connection it can send information using submitFile method (file with header and content) about already issued invoices. 
       After fiscal day is closed information is saved in device, if device has internet connection it should send information using submitFile method (file with header and footer) about closed day. However, if there are still left unsent invoices it should send information using submitFile method (file with header, content and footer) about receipts and closed day. 
After sending file device should call getFileStatus method to get sent file status. 
 
 
3. OBJECT STATUSES 
3.1. Fiscal day statuses 
 
 
Status Description 1. FiscalDayClosed Status used when fiscal device has successfully closed fiscal day. New fiscal day opening is possible only from this status. 2. FiscalDayOpened Fiscal day is opened. Invoices can be created only when fiscal day is in this status. 3. FiscalDayCloseInitiated Closure of fiscal day is initiated, however FDMS not yet validated fiscal counters. 
While Fiscal day is in status “FiscalDayCloseInitiated”, no new request to initiate fiscal day closure will be accepted from device or user. New invoices will not be accepted as well. 4. Is processing successful? If processing of report is successful, fiscal day status is changed to FiscalDayClosed, if processing of report is not successful status is changed to FiscalDayCloseFailed. 5. FiscalDayCloseFailed FDMS validated fiscal day report received from device, however there are validation errors. Device must correct issues and repeatedly submit fiscal day closure message.  
4. FISCAL DEVICE GATEWAY API INTERFACES 
       Fiscal Device Gateway API exposes its methods using REST JSON interface. All methods except closeDay and submitFile are synchronous. closeDay and submitFile methods return response about accepted request synchronously, however processing of information is done asynchronously. 
 
Each request must contain these HTTP headers: 
Header name Mandatory Description DeviceModelName Yes Device model name as registered in ZIMRA DeviceModelVersionNo Yes Device model version number as registered in ZIMRA  
       During processing of request validations are performed and these errors may be returned: 
• If device model is blacklisted error DEV04 is returned. 
• If taxpayer is not active error DEV05 is returned. 
• If device is not active error DEV01 is returned. 
4.1. verifyTaxpayerInformation 
       verifyTaxpayerInformation endpoint is used to retrieve taxpayer information from FDMS before device registration (in order user could double check if device is going to be registered to correct taxpayer). Activation key is not yet used.

4.9. submitFile 
submitFile endpoint is used to submit a batch of invoices to FDMS in a single file. Request can be sent if DeviceOperatingMode is Offline. 
 
       File can have three parts: Header (fiscal day information), Content (invoices information) and Footer (Z report information). Header is always mandatory, Content and Footer are optional (Footer can be sent without Content, Content can be sent without Footer). File must have information only from a single fiscal day (single file cannot contain receipts from different fiscal days). Information must be sent only for closed fiscal day. Elements sequence in file must be assured to be: Header, Content, Footer, otherwise file format error will be returned. Footer must be sent only in last file for particular fiscal day. 
File must be JSON format sent as base64 encoded string. 
       File will not be accepted, error will be returned to fiscal device (as specified in 8.1 Http statuses 
API can return such http statuses for errors: 
Http status Description 400 bad request – the message is malformed and could not be processed by Fiscal Backend Gateway 401 Authentication error (see Authentication and authorization) 404 Resource not found (call to not existing endpoint) 405 method not allowed – trying to access API using unsupported HTTP methos, e.g., POST to get config 422 Unprocessable Content – the instructions given by fiscal device to Fiscal Backend Gateway are incorrect, the response object ProblemDetails should contain ErrorCode to indicate the exact failing condition (e.g., DEV01 – device is blocked and therefore no instructions could be processed from such device) 500 Infrastructure error – the Fiscal Backend Gateway server is not available, or some infrastructure error occurred. The fiscal device should retry to send message later. 502 Bad gateway - the Fiscal Backend Gateway server could not be contacted. The fiscal device should retry to send message later.  
Error codes), in these cases: 
• fiscal device operating mode is other than “Offline”; 
• file is bigger than 3 MB, file should be split to smaller than 3MB files by device; 
• request structure is not valid; 
• device id in input parameters and file header are different; 
• file Header failed to be parsed; 
• file is sent for already closed day. 
In case the above-mentioned validations have passed, file is processed asynchronously.  
File status can be received by calling 4.10 getFileStatus API method. 
       If other validation issues during asynchronous processing will be detected error information may be retrieved in 4.10 getFileStatus response. 
 
During asynchronous processing these steps will be executed: 
• file structure will be validated; 
• fiscal day status validated by information provided in header; 
* invoices will be imported from file to FDMS (same validation rules will be applied as described in 4.6 openDay 
       openDay endpoint is used to open a new fiscal day. Opening of new fiscal day is possible only when previous fiscal day is successfully closed (fiscal day status is “FiscalDayClosed”). Opening of a new fiscal day in a fiscal device may be done without internet connection. It is important that such delayed request about day opening is sent before sending receipts. 
       Request can’t be sent if DeviceOperatingMode is Offline. If DeviceOperatingMode is Offline error DEV01 is received.

Validation rules: 
- fiscalDayNo must be equal to 1 for the first fiscal day of fiscal device 
- fiscalDayNo must be greater by one from the last closed fiscal day fiscalDayNo.  
Output parameters: 
Name Type Mandatory Description operationID String (60) Yes Operation ID assigned by FDMS. fiscalDayNo Int Yes Fiscal day number of opened day. 
In case device has sent fiscalDayNo in request, it is returned in this field. In case device has not sent it, new fiscal day number will be generated by FDMS.  
* submitReceipt); 
• Z report will be validated same validation rules will be applied as described in Error! Reference source not found. Error! Reference source not found.). Additional validation rules: 
• If Content and Footer are sent in a single file, they are processed as separate parts. It means that Content can be processed successfully, but Footer not successfully. In such case, invoices from Content part remains in FDMS. In case Content part fails to be processed, Footer part processing is skipped. 

• Invoice is created in FDMS only if it does not yet exist (with the same deviceID, fiscalDayNo, receiptGlobalNo and receiptHash). It means if the same file with the same invoice is sent once again, or the same invoice is sent in another file invoice processing is skipped (because it is already saved in FDMS). 
• If two files have same fiscal fiscalDayNo value but different fiscalDayOpened values. First received fiscalDayOpened value according to sequence field is saved, later received value is ignored.

6.	FISCAL COUNTERS 
       With each submitted receipt (FiscalInvoice, CreditNote and DebitNote), fiscal counters are updated. 
       After fiscal device finishes a fiscal day, it must close it by sending fiscal day report with fiscal counters provided in the table below to Fiscal Device Gateway API. Fiscal counter is optional to be sent in case it’s value is zero. 
       Counters list and calculation rules for different types of receipt and different types of receipt lines are provided below. Please take a note to use correct sign when calculating a counter (add or subtract value from counter). In case negative receipt total amount is sent, fiscal counters become a negative sign too. 
       Fiscal day counters are reset after fiscal day close. Starting from a new fiscal day, counters start to be counted from zero. 
 
       Table below lists fiscal counters and specifies either they are calculated for different tax percents, currencies and/or payment methods: 
Counter By tax By currency By payment method Description SaleByTax X X  Total sales amount (after discount) by tax and by currency during fiscal day including tax. Does not include debit notes and credit notes. SaleTaxByTax X X  Total tax amount by tax and by currency from sales (after discount) during fiscal day. Does not include debit notes and credit notes. CreditNoteByTax X X  Total credit notes amount by tax and by currency during fiscal day including tax. CreditNoteTaxByTax X X  Total tax amount by tax and by currency from credit notes during fiscal day. DebitNoteByTax X X  Total debit notes amount by tax and by currency during fiscal day including tax. DebitNoteTaxByTax X X  Total tax amount by tax and by currency from debit notes during fiscal day. BalanceByMoneyType  X X Total collected or paid amount of money, by money type and by currency during fiscal day.  
 
       Table below shows, which counters each submitted receipt type is changing and which fields from submitted receipt are used:  
Receipt type Fiscal invoice Credit note Debit note Counter SaleByTax +salesAmountWithTax   SaleTaxByTax +taxAmount   CreditNoteByTax  +salesAmountWithTax*  CreditNoteTaxByTax  +taxAmount*  DebitNoteByTax   +salesAmountWithTax DebitNoteTaxByTax   +taxAmount BalanceByMoneyType +paymentAmount +paymentAmount* +paymentAmount  
      * - for credit note salesAmountWithTax, taxAmount, paymentAmount counters will be used with negative numbers so with each credit note counter value will decrease if there wasn’t credit note(s) with receiptLineType Discount. 
7. INTEGRATION SETUP REQUIREMENTS 
7.1. Communication and security protocols 
       Fiscal Device Gateway API can be accessed using HTTPS protocol only. All Fiscal Device Gateway API methods except registerDevice and getServerCertificate use client authentication certificate which is issued by FDMS. 
 
7.2. Environment addresses 
       Fiscal Device Gateway API is accessible in testing and production (real) environments. URL to access API: 
Environment URL Testing environment https://fdmsapitest.zimra.co.zw 
Testing environment’s API can also be accessed using Swagger on https://fdmsapitest.zimra.co.zw/swagger/index.html Production environment https://fdmsapi.zimra.co.zw  
7.3. Authentication and authorization 
	Fiscal 	Device 	Gateway 	uses 	mutual 	TLS authentication 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) to authenticate fiscal device using fiscal device certificate. Fiscal device certificate is validated against issuing certificate to allow or deny access to API endpoints. 
 
Note: endpoints 4.1 verifyTaxpayerInformation, 4.2 registerDevice, 4.12 getServerCertificate are public and do not require authentication. After authentication, provided fiscal device certificate is checked against issued certificate (see 4.2 registerDevice and 4.3 issueCertificate and methods for fiscal device certificate issuing) to check if the fiscal device certificate was issued to calling device (by method parameter deviceId) and the fiscal device certificate was not revoked. 
 
The Fiscal Device Gateway will return HTTP 401 unauthorized code if: 
• The provided fiscal device certificate was issued not by Fiscal Device Gateway. 
• The provided fiscal device certificate was revoked. 
• The provided fiscal device certificate expired. 
• The provided fiscal device certificate was not issued to calling fiscal device. 
 
7.4. Timeout Settings 
Fiscal Device Gateway API response timeout for any synchronous operation – 30 seconds. 
 

8. ERRORS 
       In case of API error, the system will return 4xx or 5xx http error code with response body containing a detailed problem details structure as described in https://www.rfchttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807editor.org/rfc/rfc7807 .

8.2.1. Validation errors 
       When sumbitReceipt request is received by FDMS and it is not rejected, FDMS validates receipt data. In case previous receipt is missing, validation rules which require previous receipt to be present are temporarily marked as grey and are revalidated when previous receipt is received. After a validation, receipt is stored and signed by FDMS. Receipt validation status may be valid or invalid. In case of invalid receipt, validation errors are categorized by one of these colors: 
 
Color Description Grey This means that received receipt violates receipt chain and makes a gap in receipt chain (previous receipt is missing). Such receipt is marked in “Grey”. With each of the next received receipt, such “Grey” receipt will be revalidated (in case newly received receipt is the previous for the “Grey” receipt). After repeated validation it will remain “Grey” (if newly received receipt is not the previous for it) or become valid. 
 Fiscal day will not be allowed to be closed automatically if it has at least one “Grey” receipt.  Yellow “Yellow” validation errors are minor ones. Fiscal day will be allowed to be closed automatically if it contains only “Yellow” validation errors. Red “Red” validation errors are major ones. Fiscal day fill is not allowed to be closed automatically if it has at least one “Red” receipt.  
Possible validation errors and their color codes:

9. REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL DEVICES 
This chapter specifies requirements for fiscal devices to be met: 
1. Fiscal device must open a new fiscal day before issuing receipts and invoices. 
2. Fiscal device if internet connection is available must retrieve configuration from FDMS (getConfig endpoint) before opening a new fiscal day. 
3. Fiscal device must save data from getConfig response about taxpayer and/or its branch (taxpayer name, address, contacts, etc.) and use it for receipt and invoice printing. 
4. Fiscal device must track the time passed from opening a fiscal day, that it would not exceed maximum allowed fiscal day length (specified in parameter taxPayerDayMaxHrs) and forbid issuing new receipts and invoices after that.  
5. Fiscal device must inform user about the approaching fiscal day end. Notification must be shown to the user a few hours before maximum fiscal day length is reached. The exact number of hours left to maximum fiscal day length is specified in parameter taxpayerDayEndNotificationHrs. 
6. Fiscal device must assign receiptGlobalNo value to a receipt in a sequential order starting from 1 and continue numbering despite fiscal day close.  
7. In case receiptGlobalNo value becomes very big and taxpayer would like to reset it, this can be done by submitting the first receipt in a new fiscal day. 
8. Fiscal device must assign receiptCounter value to a receipt in a sequential order starting from 1 and continue numbering only in the same fiscal day. After fiscal day closure, receiptCounter must be reset to 0. 
9. Fiscal device must not allow to add goods or services with VAT tax to receipt or invoice if taxpayer is not a VAT taxpayer (VATNumber value is received in getConfig response). In case taxpayer gets VAT number in the middle of fiscal day, fiscal device must not allow to issue new receipts or invoices and must require closing fiscal day first. 
10. Fiscal day opening message must be sent immediately after opening a fiscal day, however if there is no connection, it can be delayed. 
11. Receipt must be sent to Fiscal Device Gateway API only after successfully opening a fiscal day. 
12. Fiscal device must send receipt to Fiscal Device Gateway API only after finishing it (when receipt is printed). 
13. Fiscal device must send receipt to Fiscal Device Gateway API one by one in ascending receiptGlobalNo order, not skipping any of receipt. In case submission of receipt failed, issue must be fixed, and receipt submission must be repeated. 
14. Fiscal device must send receipt to Fiscal Device Gateway API immediately after finishing it in case there is an internet connection and there are no waiting receipts to be sent, otherwise receipt must be put to the queue on device and send later when connection will be restored. 
15. Fiscal device must update counters after issuing a receipt and reset counters after starting a new fiscal day as specified in 6. Fiscal counters. 
16. Fiscal device must renew certificate which is near to expire before its expiration date. 
17. Offline Fiscal device must send file content only for a single closed fiscal day. File cannot contain invoices from more than one fiscal day. 
18. If file is bigger than 3 MB, content should be split into separate files, footer can’t be split to two or more separate parts. 
19. If fiscal day has a lot of receipts, it is recommended to split receipts and Z report to separate files. 
20. If offline fiscal device prepared more than one file for a single fiscal day, these files must be sent to FDMS one by one in sequential order. 
21. Offline fiscal devices must be able to export file with invoices if user requests it for manual upload to FDMS Self-service. 
22. User must not uninstall application from device if there are unsent invoices.

11. RECEIPT QR CODE RULES 
       Each issued receipt and invoice must contain QR code value printed as text and preferably also QR code picture (in case printer is capable to print it). QR code represents deep link URL with receipt identification information. QR code consists of this information: 
 
Name Length* Description qrUrl  URL for QR validation, received in Error! Reference source not found. (POS needs to add / at the end of URL before adding other fields to URL). deviceID 10 Device ID represented in 10 digits number with leading zeros. receiptDate 8 Invoice date (receiptDate field value) represented in 8 digits (format: 
ddMMyyyy). receiptGlobalNo 10 Receipt global number (receiptGlobalNo field value) issued by device represented in 10 digits with leading zeros receiptQrData 16 Receipt QR data field (first 16 characters of MD5 hash from ReceiptDeviceSignature hexadecimal format value).        * - length specifies a fixed length of value, which should be included in QR. In case value is shorter than indicated length, leading zeros must be added in front.

13.SIGNATURES GENERATION AND VERIFICATION RULES 13.1. Signature an hash generation algorithm 
Below algorithm is used to generate receipt and fiscal day hash and signature: 
1) Receipt or fiscal day fields must be converted to string (by rules as described in table below) and concatenated (no concatenation character is used); 
2) Concatenated line must be hashed using SHA256 to get the hash; 
3) Concatenated line must be signed with private key to get the signature. 
Formula to get a hash: Hash = SHA-256(x1|| x2||…||xn); Formula to get a signature: 
Signature = RSA(x1|| x2||…||xn,d,n) – in case RSA keys are used or 
Signature = ECC(Hash,CURVE,g,n) – in case ECC keys are used 
 
Where 
|| - means field concatenation; x1, x2, …, xn  - receipt or fiscal day fields; 
d – secret RSA exponent; n - RSA modulus 
CURVE – the elliptic curve field and equation used 
       G – elliptic curve base point, a point on the curve that generates a subgroup of large prime order n n – integer order of G, means that n x G=O, where O is the identity element. 
13.2. Receipt signature generation and verification 
Receipt hash and signature are generated according to the rules provided in section 
13.1. 
13.2.1. Receipt device signature 
       Fields included in receipt hash which is used for device signature are (these fields must be included in hash in the same order as provided below): 
Order Field name Description 1 deviceID Device ID 2 receiptType Receipt type value in upper case. 3 receiptCurrency Currency code (ISO 4217 currency code). It must be in upper case. 4 receiptGlobalNo Receipt global number. 5 receiptDate Date in ISO 8601 format <date>T<time>, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss (hours are represented in 24 hours format, local time). 
Example: 2019-09-23T14:43:23 6 receiptTotal Receipt total is included in signature in cents. 
Examples: 
- If receiptTotal is 500 ZWL, value 50000 must be used in signature. 
- If receiptTotal is 12,34 USD, value 1234 must be used in signature. 
- If receiptTotal is 0,05 USD, value 5 must be used in signature. 7 receiptTaxes Concatenated receiptTaxes, where each line is concatenated in this way: taxCode || taxPercent || taxAmount || salesAmountWithTax. 
 
In case of taxPercent is not sent, empty value should be used in signature. 
Amounts are represented in cents. In case taxPercent is not an integer there should be dot between the integer and fractional part. In case of exempt which does not send tax percent value, empty value should be used in signature. In case taxPercent is an integer there should be value of tax percent, dot and two zeros sent. 
Taxes are ordered by taxID in ascending order and taxCode in alphabetical order (if taxCode is empty it is ordered before A letter). 
Examples: 
- If taxPercent is 15, value 15.00 must be used in signature. 
- If taxPercent is 14.5 value 14.50 must be used in signature. 
- If taxPercent is 0 value 0.00 must be used in signature. 8 previousReceiptHash Previous receipt hash is included into current receipt device signature. This will create a chain of receipts. 
This field is not used in signature when current receipt is first in fiscal day.

13.2.2. Receipt FDMS signature 
       Receipt FDMS signature may be verified by decrypting receiptServerSignature with FDMS public key and comparing if it matches with prepared receipt hash. receiptServerSignature is generated only for receipt submitted in “Online” receipt mode. Hash generation algorithm is provided in section 13.1. 
 
       Fields included in receipt hash which is used for FDMS signature are (these fields must be included in hash in the same order as provided below):

13.3. Fiscal day signature generation and verification 
       Fiscal day report hash and signature are generated according to the rules provided in section 13.1. 
13.3.1. Fiscal day device signature 
       Fields included in fiscal day hash used for device signature are provided below (these fields must be included in hash in the same order as provided below): 
Order Field name Description 1 deviceID Device ID 2 fiscalDayNo Fiscal day number 3 fiscalDayDate Fiscal day date (date when fiscal day was opened). 
Date in ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DD. 
Example: 2019-09-23 4 fiscalDayCounters Concatenated fiscal day counter lines, where each line is concatenated in this way: fiscalCounterType || fiscalCounterCurrency || fiscalCounterTaxPercent or fiscalCounterMoneyType || fiscalCounterValue. 
 
All text values are concatenated in upper case. 
Amounts are represented in cents. 
Only non-zero value fiscal counters are included in concatenation. Fiscal counters are concatenated in this order: 
• fiscalCounterType (in ascending order) 
• fiscalCounterCurrency (in alphabetical ascending order) 
• fiscalCounterTaxID (in ascending order) / fiscalCounterMoneyType (in ascending order) 
In case taxPercent is not an integer there should be dot between the integer and fractional part. In case of exempt which does not send tax percent value, empty value should be used in signature. In case taxPercent is an integer there should be value of tax percent, dot and two zeros sent. 
Examples: 
- If taxPercent is 15, value 15.00 must be used in signature. 
- If taxPercent is 14.5 value 14.50 must be used in signature. 
- If taxPercent is 0 value 0.00 must be used in signature.
